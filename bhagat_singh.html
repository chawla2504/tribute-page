        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Bhagat Singh, born on September 28, 1907, in Banga, Punjab, India, was a charismatic and fearless
            revolutionary who played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence. His unwavering commitment to
            the cause and his sacrifice for the nation have etched his name in the annals of history.</p>

        <h2>Early Life and Influences</h2>
        <p>Bhagat Singh's early life was marked by a deep sense of patriotism, influenced significantly by the
            Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919 and the non-violent protests led by Mahatma Gandhi. Despite coming from a
            family with a history of freedom fighters, Bhagat Singh was drawn towards more radical methods in the fight
            against British colonial rule.</p>

        <h2>Joining the Revolutionary Cause</h2>
        <p>In his early twenties, Bhagat Singh became an active member of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association
            (HSRA), a revolutionary organization that aimed at ending British rule through armed struggle. He believed
            in the power of direct action and was willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for the freedom of his country.
        </p>

        <h2>The Lahore Conspiracy Case</h2>
        <p>Bhagat Singh gained widespread attention when he and his associates plotted to avenge the death of Lala
            Lajpat Rai, who had succumbed to injuries inflicted during a protest against the Simon Commission. In an
            unfortunate turn of events, J.A. Scott, a police officer, was killed instead. Bhagat Singh, along with his
            comrades, was subsequently arrested and tried in the Lahore Conspiracy Case.</p>

        <h2>The Hunger Strike</h2>
        <p>While in prison, Bhagat Singh and his fellow inmates embarked on a hunger strike to protest against the
            inhumane treatment of political prisoners. Their resilience garnered support from various quarters and
            brought attention to the deplorable conditions faced by those who dared to challenge British rule.</p>

        <h2>Martyrdom for the Cause</h2>
        <p>On March 23, 1931, Bhagat Singh, along with Rajguru and Sukhdev, was hanged by the British authorities. His
            martyrdom left an indelible mark on the Indian consciousness, inspiring countless individuals to continue
            the struggle for independence. The sacrifice made by Bhagat Singh and his comrades serves as a symbol of
            unwavering determination in the face of oppression.</p>

        <h2>Legacy and Inspiration</h2>
        <p>Bhagat Singh's legacy extends far beyond the pages of history. His commitment to justice, equality, and
            freedom continues to inspire generations of Indians. The words "Inquilab Zindabad" (Long Live the
            Revolution), coined by him, echo through time, reminding us of the spirit that fueled the fight for
            independence.</p>
